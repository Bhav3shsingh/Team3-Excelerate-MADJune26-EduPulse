# App Proposal: EduPulse
## ​1. Purpose of the App
​EduPulse is a dual-sided educational ecosystem designed to bridge the gap between event coordinators and participants. The application solves communication gaps, automates attendance tracking, and simplifies the feedback loop, creating a frictionless administrative experience while boosting learner engagement.

1. Welcome Screen (`WelcomePage`) - landing page with a full-width background image, centered welcome text, and buttons for learner and admin login flows.
2. Login Screen (`LoginPage`) - email/password fields, login button, forgot password link, and a create-account link that passes the selected user type.
3. Register Screen (`RegisterPage`) - registration form for new users, including user details and role selection for learners or admins.
4. Main Screen (`MainScreen`) - bottom navigation container with Dashboard, Programs, and Profile tabs for authenticated users.
5. Dashboard Screen (`DashboardPage`) - role-aware dashboard content, summary cards, and quick access to programs or notifications.
6. Program Listing Screen (`ProgramListingPage`, `ProgramListingPageAdmin`) - Firestore-backed program cards, filtered by user role with admin-specific management actions.
7. Program Details Screen (`ProgramDetails`) - detailed event/program information, schedule fields, participant management, and action buttons for join or edit.
8. Program Create/Edit Screen (`ProgramCreateScreen`, `ProgramEditScreen`) - admin forms for creating new programs or updating existing program data.
9. Pending Admin Approval Screen (`MasterAdminApprovalPage`) - admin review list for pending user approvals and role validation.
10. Notifications Screen (`NotificationScreen`) - view and browse app notifications and announcements.
11. New Notification Screen (`Notifier`) - admin notification creation interface for sending messages to users.
12. Feedback/Form Screen (`FormScreen`) - feedback and form submission screen for program responses.
13. Admin Review Screen (`AdminReview`) - admin review and moderation screen for feedback or program assessments.
